This repository hosts some of the important work I have accomplished (some more complete than others) within the courses of Autonomous Robotics and Visual Perception!


DISCLAIMER : Due to the usage of different Matlab versions, mainly 2018, 2020, & 2021 (as different computers were in use) the results, scripts and functions may differ.
